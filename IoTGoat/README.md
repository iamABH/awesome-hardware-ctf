# OWASP IoTGoat

## Description

OWASP IoTGoat project is a vulnerable router firmware based on OpenWrt to practice research IoT vulnerabilities from the [OWASP IoT top 10](https://wiki.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Internet_of_Things_Project#tab=IoT_Top_10) like [Juice Shop](https://github.com/juice-shop/juice-shop) or [mutilidae](https://owasp.org/www-project-mutillidae-ii/) for learning web security.
It is kinda old but still useful to learn.

You can either work on a virtual environment, or flash the firmware on a raspberry Pi 2.
