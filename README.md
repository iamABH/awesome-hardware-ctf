# üß∞ Awesome Hardware CTF

Awesome Hardware CTF is a curated list of **hardware-oriented** CTF challenges.

We did not create these challenges but only intend to centralize the challenges which are of various platforms and lost in the galaxy of the World Wide Web.

We deeply want this repo to be as complete as possible, and this, on all the topics that hardware hacking can cover.
