# HackTheBox

## Description

There is a whole hardware category on hackthebox with dozens of well-designed challenges.

Topics vary from RF to reverse firmware, mqtt, ICS, etc...

Write-ups are not allowed on active challenges but I will post as many write-ups as possible on challenges as soon as they are retired!

You can ask for help on the hackthebox discord though for active challenges.
